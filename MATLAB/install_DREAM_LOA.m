% In root directory of DREAM_LOA
addpath(pwd,[pwd '/miscellaneous']);
% Now go to example directory; say example_1
cd example_1
% Now execute this example by typing in command prompt: "example_1" 

% After DREAM_LOA terminates, create a 2d matrix from 3D-chain array
% P = genparset(chain);
% This matrix will have all samples of the joint chains (thinning active)
% Burn-in of P is required to get posterior samples
% Last column of P lists the # limits satisfied (= fitness function)
