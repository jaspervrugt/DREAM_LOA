# DREAM_LOA: Limits of Acceptability with DREAM algorithm: MATLAB and Python Toolboxes

## Description

DiffeRential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithm with Limits of Acceptability (LOA) sampling. The MATLAB and Python toolboxes delineate the behavioural solution space of set-theoretic likelihood functions used within the GLUE LOA framework \citep{beven1992,beven2001,beven2006,beven2014}. The algorithm builds on the DREAM$_\text{(ABC)}$ algorithm of \cite{sadegh2014} and enhances significantly the accuracy and CPU-efficiency of Bayesian inference with GLUE. In particular it is shown how lack of adequate sampling in the model space might lead to unjustified model rejection.

## Getting Started

### Installing: MATLAB

* Download and unzip the zip file 'MATLAB_code_DREAM_LOA_V1.0.zip' in a directory 'DREAM_LOA'
* Add the toolbox to your MATLAB search path by running the script 'install_DREAM_LOA.m' available in the root directory
* You are ready to run the examples.

### Executing program

* After intalling, you can simply direct to each example folder and execute the local 'example_X.m' file.
* Please make sure you read carefully the instructions (i.e., green comments) in 'install_DREAM_LOA.m'  

### Installing: Python

* Download and unzip the zip file 'Python_code_DREAM_LOA_V1.0.zip' to a directory called 'DREAM_LOA'.

### Executing program

* Go to Command Prompt and directory of example_X in the root of 'DREAM_LOA'
* Now you can execute this example by typing 'python example_X.py'
* Instructions can be found in the file 'DREAM_LOA.py'
